# The-Tower-Calculators
A set of Calculator Tools for "The Tower" mobile game. Includes things like a calculator for the most efficient Golden Tower upgrade to purchase.
Designed for The Tower, a mobile game developed by Tech Tree.

This is intended to be a set of automatic tools or calculators to help the user figure out what they should be spending their stones or coins on.
The tools function by taking user input that tells the calculator what all of your current upgrades and labs are, 
  and from there it gets prices from a data table and determines what the most cost effective upgrade for you to get is.
This project in the end will include a Golden Tower, Death Wave, and a Damage vs Critical lab efficiency calculator in version 1.0
